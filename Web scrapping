# There are two very similar code for webscrapping
Both used for scrapping the prices of petrol from the website
The 2nd code is the one to use from the 2013 onwards. The one thing to change is the path of table as all of them has a different path of tables. However,
in the future i will try to work a way top ileterate them so i can get the combined prices of all the tables at once . Each year was presented by a different
table path
